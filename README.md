# Xingyuan Charts · public chart data (China's 9 music platforms)

Twice-daily, machine-readable snapshots of the **public charts** on nine Chinese music
platforms — NetEase Cloud Music, QQ Music, Kugou, Kuwo, Qishui, Douyin, Weibo, Bilibili
and Apple Music. Eighteen charts per snapshot: hot/rising boards plus new-song boards.

This repository is the data mirror of <https://xingyuan.beer/charts.json>. It is updated
after each collection run (09:40 and 21:40 Asia/Shanghai, twice a day).

<!-- LATEST:BEGIN -->
| field | value |
|---|---|

| boards | 18 |
| rows | 1598 |

## Files

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `data/latest.json` | the newest snapshot, same schema as `/charts.json` |
| `data/latest.csv` | flat table, one row per chart position |
| `data/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<HHMM>.json` | per-run archive (kept, never rewritten) |

## Schema (`data/latest.json`)

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `captured_at` | when the chart pages were read (Asia/Shanghai). Every number in the file refers to this moment. |
| `boards[]` | one object per chart: `platform`, `board`, `board_name`, `kind` (`base` / `rise`), `total`, `tracks[]` |
| `tracks[].rank` | position on that chart (platform's own numbering) |
| `tracks[].rank_delta` | `> 0` moved up, `< 0` moved down, `0` unchanged, `null` no previous run |
| `tracks[].is_new` | first appearance on that chart |
| `tracks[].streak` | consecutive runs on the chart |
| `tracks[].dedupe_key` | cross-platform identity key (title + lead artist, normalised). Same key = same song on different platforms. |
| `cross[]` | songs charting on two or more platforms in this run |

Chart depth is whatever the platform publishes: most boards expose 50 positions, three
Kuwo boards 20, Qishui New Songs 43. We never pad a chart to a round number.

## What this is not

- No play counts, no revenue, no estimates — only published positions.
- No audio, no lyrics, no cover-art mirroring.
- No user data. Ever.

## Using it

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gezhongjian/xingyuan-charts-data/main/data/latest.json | jq '.boards | length'
```

If you quote this data, cite **Xingyuan Charts (星愿榜单)** with the `captured_at` value,
and link <https://xingyuan.beer/?src=github>.

## Update cadence

Two runs per day. A missing run means the platforms blocked that collection — the archive
keeps the previous snapshot intact rather than writing a partial one.
